    "## Problem\n",
    "While developing solutions or new technologies, engineers are faced with balancing trade-offs in their design. For example, in designing a car, reducing the size could increase fuel efficiency but result in lower crash safety ratings. Computer scientists and software engineers typically need to balance the speed of their programs with the amount of memory they require to execute. One way to approach these trade-offs is to define some constraints and then optimize the design within those constraints. In our car design example, we could define a minimum safety rating and then design the car to maximize fuel efficiency while still meeting our minimum safety rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week’s lab, you will be writing a function that will check whether a design meets a particular constraint. For our problem, we will imagine we are designing the layout of a wind farm and are trying to [identify where to place hundreds of turbines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148118303641). We want to optimize turbine placement to maximize energy generation while adhering to land use constraints. These constraints define areas where turbines cannot be placed. These constraints come from land rights, proximity to other turbines, and regulations regarding turbine proximity to human housing and natural habitats.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/wind_farm.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write a function named `define_rectangle_overlap` which will analyze whether two rectangles overlap in two-dimensional space. In cases where the rectangles overlap, your function will determine and *return* the nature of the overlap (details below). In the context of our problem, these rectangles can be thought of as a restricted area and a proposed turbine site. The output of the function will tell us whether the proposed location meets the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the rectangles input to the function will be defined by **two points**: the bottom left corner and the top right corner (see figure 1).\n",
