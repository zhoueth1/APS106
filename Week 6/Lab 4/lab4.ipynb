    "* Extract substrings from strings using indexing and string methods\n",
    "* Use operations and string methods to generate new strings\n",
    "* Convert between variable types\n",
    "* Utilize while loops to repeat segments of code until a condition is satisfied\n",
    "* Practice writing and debugging boolean expressions, conditionals, and loops\n",
    "* Understand how to convert between notebooks and .py files\n",

    "## Lab Deliverables\n",
    "The following files must be submitted to Gradescope prior to the assignment deadline:\n",
    "1. `lab4.ipynb`\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "This week, we will imagine you are an engineer working on a treatment process for wastewater from a mine. To evaluate whether your design is effectively desalinating the wastewater, you hire several technicians to measure the pH of treated water at multiple locations around the mine every day.\n",
    "Everyday, the measurements from each technician are recorded and uploaded to a database as a string with the following format:\n",
    "*Technician email, date, site name, pH measurement, site name, pH measurement, site name, pH measurement, …*\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* *technician email* is the email of the technician\n",
    "* *date* is the day the measurements were taken, formatted as DD/MM/YY.\n",
    "* *site name* is the name of the site where a measurement was taken\n",
    "* *pH measurement* is the measured pH at that site. The measurements are taken to 2 decimal points.\n",
    "Note that there are multiple site-measurement pairs. The number of measurements can vary each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example strings\n",
    "1. `\"dina.dominguez@company.com, 28/11/24, A, 4.20, B, 6.74, Control, 7.10, B, 6.45, Control, 7.88, Control, 6.38, A, 3.95\"`\n",
    "2. `\"jamie.riggs@company.com, 15/12/23, B, 5.67, Control, 5.56, Db, 3.22, Control, 6.15, Control, 5.99\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first string contains measurements by Dina Dominguez from Nov. 28, 2024. There are a total of seven measurements from three sites (A, B, and Control). The second string contains measurements by Jamie Riggs from Dec. 15, 2023. There are a total of five measurements from three sites (B, Db, and Control).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming task\n",
    "You are interested in extracting the following information from each string:\n",
    "1.\tThe date the measurements were taken\n",
    "1.\tThe name of the technician\n",
    "1.\tThe average pH measurement at specific sites\n",
    "\n",
    "After a few weeks, there are hundreds of measurements being added to the database every day and you are finding that manually analyzing and extracting information is very inefficient. Luckily, you have programming skills from APS106 that will help you efficiently extract the information you need. So you decide to write a program to extract the information you need from each string and generate new stings that can be analyzed quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special instructions for completing this lab\n",
    "In this lab you will get experience with using both Jupyter notebooks (this file) and `.py` files in the PyCharm IDE.\n",
    "Knowing how to use both types of files is an important part of your Python programming toolkit. Luckily, as you'll get to see in this lab, the differences are not\n",

    "1. Follow the instructions in this notebook file to complete the functions required for this lab.\n",
    "1. Once your functions are complete, follow the instructions at the end of the Notebook to transfer your code to the `lab4.py` file. This is the file that will be graded by Gradescope.\n",
